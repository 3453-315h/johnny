Overview
========

Johnny is a cross-platform GUI frontend for John the Ripper, the popular
password cracker, written in C++ using the Qt framework.

Johnny's aim is to automate and simplify the password cracking routines as well
as add extra functionality like session management, using the immense capabilities
and features offered by John the Ripper.

The application uses John The Ripper for the actual work, thus it needs to be
installed on your system. Official core version or the community-enhanced
version (jumbo) are both supported.
