There are two ways to install Johnny which depends on your platform.
1. Use our easy installer (Windows and OS X only)
2. Download source and build Johnny (all platforms)

=====================
Windows and OS X only
=====================

1. Easy-install : use our installer
-----------------------------------
Simply visit http://openwall.info/wiki/john/johnny to get the latest installer
for your platform and http://openwall.info/wiki/john/custom-builds to get the latest
John The Ripper binaries.

============================
Unix/Linux, Windows and OS X
============================

2. Getting the source code and compiling
----------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
   * Qt 4.6.2 or later (may or may not work on earlier versions too).
     We recommend the most up to date qt version available on your system.
   * If you don't have Qt, use the easy online installer available at
        http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
   * John The Ripper, official or jumbo version. We recommend the latest jumbo version
   available at http://openwall.info/wiki/john/custom-builds to get access to all Johnny features.

After installing Qt and John, open a terminal and follow these steps :
1) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
2) git checkout v2.0 # switch to the desired version
3) qmake
4) make (or mingw32-make or nmake or jom, depending on your platform)
5) ./johnny

(Optional) To clean the build directory:
make clean && make distclean

If you prefer using an IDE, you can also open the project (johnny.pro)
in Qt Creator and it'll automate most of these steps.
