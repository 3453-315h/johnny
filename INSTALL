There are two ways to install Johnny which depends on your platform.
1. Use our easy installer (Windows and OS X only)
2. Download source and build Johnny (all platforms)

As Johnny requires John The Ripper to work, the first step is to get the
latest John The Ripper binary for your platform. Official version or
community-enhanced version (jumbo) are both supported. You can grab JtR at
http://openwall.info/wiki/john/custom-builds .

Asumming that John The Ripper is installed on your system, the next step is
to install Johnny.

=====================
Windows and OS X
=====================

Simply visit http://openwall.info/wiki/john/johnny to get the latest installer
for your platform.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On other platforms, it is required to build Johnny from source. The steps
depend on the family of your distro.

============================
FreeBSD 10.1
============================

1) pkg install git qt5-core qt5-widgets qt5-qmake qt5-buildtools
2) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
3) git checkout v2.0 # switch to the desired version
4) /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
5) Edit the resulted Makefile and append ",-L,/usr/local/lib" to the LFLAGS line. Somehow
the clang++ spec of qmake ommits that on FreeBSD. The complete line should look like this:
LFLAGS        = -pthread -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib,-L,/usr/local/lib
6) make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
7) ./johnny

====================
Debian based distros
====================

These steps apply to all the Debian (included) based flavors such as Ubuntu, Mint etc.

1) sudo apt-get install g++ git qtbase5-dev
2) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
3) git checkout v2.0 # switch to the desired version
4) export QT_SELECT=qt5
5) qmake && make -j$(nproc)
6) ./johnny

=====================
Red Hat based distros
=====================

Tested on Fedora 22

1) sudo yum install gcc-c++ git qt5-qtbase-devel
2) git clone https://github.com/shinnok/johnny.git && cd johnny
3) git checkout v2.0 # switch to the desired version
4) qmake-qt5 && make -j$(nproc)
5) ./johnny

On any platform, if you prefer using an IDE, you can download Qt Creator at http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
and open the project (johnny.pro). It'll automate most of these steps.
