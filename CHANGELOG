Version 2.0
===========
Faster, leaner and better looking.

Johnny got a reboot after more than 3 years of inactivity. It has been refactored
from the ground up for better cross platform compatibility, multithreaded operation,
upgraded looks, improved usability and extended JtR functionality coverage.

Contributions from Mathieu Laprise as a student coder for GSoC 2015 with mentoring
from Shinnok and Aleksey.

What's new:

* Fork and OpenMP attack preferences added
* Manual password guessing via the Guess button
* Hash type suggestion in the Passwords table
* Session history and proper session attack preferences persistence
* Ability to set environment variables for each session
* The application is more efficient and uses proper threading for seamless operation
* Proper translation support; with French translation added

Previous to 2.0 we didn't maintain a proper CHANGELOG.
